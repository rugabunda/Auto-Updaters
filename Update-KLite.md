# K-Lite Codec Pack PowerShell Updater (v1.9.3)

## Overview

This PowerShell script automates the process of keeping your K-Lite Codec Pack installation up-to-date. It can:

*   Detect your currently installed K-Lite Codec Pack variant (Basic, Standard, Full, or Mega) and its version.
*   If K-Lite is not installed, prompt you to choose which variant you'd like to install.
*   Check the official Codec Guide website for the latest version of your specific K-Lite variant.
*   Check for universal incremental updates that can be applied to your installed version.
*   Prioritize updates:
    1.  A full installer for your specific variant if it's newer.
    2.  An incremental update if it's applicable and newer.
*   Perform unattended (silent) installations:
    *   For **Basic, Standard, Full, and Mega** variants:
        *   If a corresponding `klcp_[variant]_unattended.ini` file (e.g., `klcp_full_unattended.ini`) is present in the script's directory, it will be used for a fully customized silent installation via a temporary batch file.
        *   If the INI file for a specific variant is *not* found, the script will attempt a standard silent installation for that variant (without INI customization) and issue a warning.
    *   For **Incremental** updates: These are always installed silently without an INI file.
*   Use the `/FORCEUPGRADE` switch during installation to prevent the process from being aborted if applications are found to be using codec files.
*   After a fresh installation of any K-Lite variant, the script performs an immediate "second pass" check to see if any incremental updates can be applied to the just-installed version.
*   Clean up downloaded installer files and temporary batch files after installation attempts.

## Prerequisites

1.  **PowerShell Version:** 5.1 or higher.
2.  **Administrator Privileges:** The script must be run as an Administrator to install software.
3.  **Internet Connection:** Required to check for updates and download installers.
4.  **Unattended INI Files (Optional but Recommended for Full Customization):**
    *   For a fully customized silent installation of a specific K-Lite variant (Basic, Standard, Full, or Mega), you need to create an unattended INI file for that variant. For automated or silent installations of K-Lite Codec Pack, itâ€™s strongly recommended to follow the official unattended installation instructions provided by the developers: https://www.codecguide.com/silentinstall.htm
    *   Name your INI files as follows and place them in the **same directory** as the `Auto-Update-KLite.ps1` script:
        *   `klcp_basic_unattended.ini`
        *   `klcp_standard_unattended.ini`
        *   `klcp_full_unattended.ini`
        *   `klcp_mega_unattended.ini`
    *   You can generate these INI files by running the *OFFICIAL* K-Lite installer once with the `INSTALLERFILENAME /unattended` command-line switch, going through the setup options you want, and then copying the saved INI.
    *   If an INI file for a specific variant (Basic, Standard, Mega, or even Full if its INI is missing) is not found, the script will attempt a generic silent installation for that variant, which might not include all your preferred component selections or settings.

## How to Use

1.  **Download/Save the Script:** Save the PowerShell script as `Auto-Update-KLite.ps1`.
2.  **Prepare INI Files (Optional):**
    *   If you want customized silent installations for specific K-Lite variants, create your `klcp_[variant]_unattended.ini` files as described in "Prerequisites."
    *   Place these INI files in the **same directory** as `Auto-Update-KLite.ps1`.
3.  **Run the Script:**
    *   Right-click on `Auto-Update-KLite.ps1` and select "Run with PowerShell".
    *   Alternatively, open PowerShell as an Administrator, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run it:
        ```powershell
        .\Auto-Update-KLite.ps1
        ```
4.  **Follow Prompts (If Any):**
    *   If K-Lite is not installed, you will be prompted to choose which variant (Basic, Standard, Full, Mega) you wish to install. The options will be displayed in an ordered list.

## Script Logic Flow

1.  **Initial Setup:**
    *   Determines script directory and paths for downloads and temporary files.
    *   Checks PowerShell version and administrator privileges.
2.  **Detect Installed K-Lite:**
    *   Checks the registry for an existing K-Lite installation.
    *   If found, determines the installed version and variant (Basic, Standard, Full, Mega).
    *   If not found, sets a flag for a fresh install scenario.
3.  **Variant Selection (for Fresh Installs):**
    *   If K-Lite is not installed, prompts the user to select a variant from an ordered menu.
    *   If K-Lite is installed but the variant couldn't be determined from the registry, it defaults to checking/updating the "Full" variant.
4.  **Fetch Latest Version Information:**
    *   Fetches the latest version details for the target K-Lite variant installer from its specific page on `codecguide.com`.
    *   Fetches the latest universal incremental update details from `codecguide.com/klcp_update.htm`.
5.  **Decision Making (Update or Install):**
    *   **Fresh Install:** If K-Lite is not installed, it will proceed to download and install the chosen variant.
    *   **Update Existing:**
        *   It prioritizes the full installer for the detected/target variant if it's newer than the installed version.
        *   If the variant's full installer isn't newer, it checks if the incremental update is applicable and newer.
            *   The script attempts to parse the "From" version of the incremental package from the website.
            *   If the "From" version is known and matches, it uses the incremental.
            *   If the "From" version is *unknown* but the "To" version is newer, it will proceed with the incremental update with a warning.
        *   If no suitable update is found, it reports that K-Lite is up-to-date.
6.  **Download and Install:**
    *   If an update/install is needed, the appropriate installer (`.exe`) is downloaded to a subfolder named `Klite_Downloads` (created in the script's directory).
    *   **For Basic, Standard, Full, or Mega variants:**
        *   Checks for a corresponding `klcp_[variant]_unattended.ini` file in the script's directory.
        *   If the INI exists: The INI is copied to the download folder, a temporary batch file (`_temp_klcp_variant_install.bat`) is created, and the installer is run via this batch file using the INI.
        *   If the INI does NOT exist: A warning is issued, and the installer is executed directly with generic silent switches (no INI customization).
    *   **For Incremental updates:** The installer is executed directly with generic silent switches (no INI, no batch file).
    *   All installations use `/VERYSILENT /NORESTART /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /FORCEUPGRADE`.
7.  **Post-Fresh-Install Incremental Check:**
    *   If a fresh installation of a K-Lite variant was just performed successfully, the script immediately re-checks if any incremental updates can be applied to this newly installed version.
    *   If an applicable incremental update is found, it's downloaded and installed.
8.  **Cleanup:**
    *   After an installation attempt, the downloaded installer `.exe` file is deleted.
    *   If a temporary batch file and copied INI were used, they are also deleted from the download subfolder.
    *   The `Klite_Downloads` folder itself is kept.
9.  **Finish:** Reports script completion status.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Must run as Administrator":** Ensure you are running the script with administrator privileges.
*   **"Failed to fetch page":**
    *   Check your internet connection.
*   **Version Parsing Warnings/Errors:** The K-Lite website structure can change. If the script consistently fails to parse version information (especially the "From" version for incremental updates), the regular expressions within the script may need updating.
*   **Installation Fails (Non-zero Exit Code):**
    *   The exit code from the K-Lite installer will be displayed. Some non-zero codes might indicate a reboot is required.
    *   If a temporary batch file was used (for Basic/Standard/Full/Mega with an INI), check the console output for any messages from the batch script, including a directory listing which can help verify if the installer was present.
    *   Ensure your unattended INI file (if used) is correctly configured.
*   **Path Issues:** The script is designed to create a `Klite_Downloads` subfolder within the directory where `Auto-Update-KLite.ps1` is located. If downloads go elsewhere, check the `$ScriptDir` initialization at the top of the script.
